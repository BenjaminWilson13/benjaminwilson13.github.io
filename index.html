						<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
						Hi there üëã
						</br>
						Ben here, I'm a freshly graduated Software Engineer from App Academy.
						</br>
						</br>
						Computers and software have been a lifelong interest of mine though until now I've only explored
						custom PC building and computer networks. I experimented with programming in the past but
						couldn‚Äôt get deep enough into it on my own to make a career out of it. I'm excited I'm finally
						getting the opportunity to pursue my dream of working as a programmer.
						</br>
						</br>
						I worked as a truck driver for about 8 years until I needed to make a change. I became a student
						at AppAcademy and learned more than I ever thought I could in such a short time period.
						</br>
						</br>
						My time as a truck driver taught me how to be a self-motivator. No one looks over your shoulder
						in the cab of a truck so it's up to you to make sure you run on time and make the miles you need
						to make.
						</br>
						</br>
						I also learned how to identify things that would affect my schedule and report to my dispatch
						was as much information as I could gather. Things like:
						</br>
						üöõ How late I would be
						</br>
						üöõ The route with major cities along the way in case they could have me swap loads with another
						driver, and a general breakdown of what caused the delay
						</br>
						üöõ Why my current driving hours wouldn't allow for on time delivery
						</br>
						</br>
						‚≠êThe first project I worked on: https://meetup-clone-project-n8eu.onrender.com This was built
						using an express backend and react-redux front end. This was the first time I used the skills I
						had been developing to create something real. It's not as polished as my later projects but was
						an important step in my growth as a developer.
						</br>
						</br>
						üåüThe second project: https://discordia-dz4f.onrender.com/ This was the first time put the
						skills I developed during the first project to use. I became faster at creating backend routes
						in Flask with SQAlchemy and components in React-Redux. The group dynamic was very different from
						working as a solo developer, but I found that I prefer to working as part of a group on a single
						project rather than working alone. If you take the time to look at any of my projects, this is
						the one to check out!
						</br>
						</br>
						‚≠êThe third project: https://customey.onrender.com This is where everything fully came together.
						My code became much cleaner and easier to read. I was able to create more than one or two
						components per day and made much, much faster progress on this project than I ever envisioned I
						could during the first two. While not as complicated as my group project, my coding style and
						skill are on full display here.
						</br>
						</br>
						üìßIf you're a fellow developer or recruiter and would like to connect, please reach out either
						here or by email at: benjamin.blake.wilson13@gmail.com
